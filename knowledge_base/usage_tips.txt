Tips for Cooking with Kutral

1. Marinade Magic:
Mix Kutral with olive oil, lime juice, and soy sauce for a smoky marinade perfect for chicken, tofu, or portobello mushrooms.

2. Stir-in Boost:
Add 1 tsp of Kutral to soups, stews, or beans during simmering for an earthy, spicy kick.

3. Quick Dip:
Combine Kutral with sour cream, vegan mayo, or Greek yogurt for an instant smoky dip or sandwich spread.

4. Pasta Flavor Bomb:
Melt Kutral in butter or olive oil and toss with pasta, roasted veggies, or shrimp.

5. Pizza Upgrade:
After baking, dot your pizza with small amounts of Kutral for bursts of flavor and smokiness.

6. Breakfast:
Spread on toast with avocado or stir into scrambled eggs for a smoky, savory breakfast twist.

Start small! Kutral is concentrated and can be strong if overused.
